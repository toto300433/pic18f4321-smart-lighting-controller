## üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up the Hardware

To use the smart lighting controller, you'll need to connect the necessary hardware components:

- **Microcontroller:** PIC18F4321
- **RFID Reader:** MFRC522
- **Input Keypad:** 3√ó4 keypad
- **LCD Display:** For showing status messages
- **Power Supply:** Ensure your setup has adequate power

### Connection Instructions

1. Connect the RFID reader to the microcontroller using SPI protocol.
2. Connect the keypad to the designated input pins.
3. Link the LCD to the microcontroller's output pins.
4. Set up the power supply to the microcontroller and other components.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running the Software

After successfully downloading and installing the software, follow these steps to run it:

1. Open the file you downloaded.
2. The program will initialize and guide you through setup prompts on the LCD.
3. Follow the displayed instructions using the keypad to configure your lighting system.

### Authentication Process

To switch on your lights, you will need an RFID tag:

1. Present your RFID tag to the reader.
2. Wait for the system to authenticate.
3. Once authenticated, you will have access to control the lights.

## üí° Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure access via RFID.
- **Room Control:** Manage six lights with a simple user interface.
- **PWM Control:** Adjust brightness levels (11 levels available).
- **User-Friendly Menu:** Navigate through options using the keypad.
- **Display Status:** Real-time updates shown on an LCD screen.

## üìâ Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while using the smart lighting controller, refer to this troubleshooting guide:
